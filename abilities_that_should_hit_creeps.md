#### Require reworks:
* Aeon Disk
* Ancient Apparition - Ice Blast
* Grimstroke - Ink Swell
* Mars - Spear of Mars
* Monkey King - Jingu Mastery
* Nyx Assassin - Spiked Carapace
* Outworld Devourer - Sanity's Eclipse
* Tinker - Laser Scepter bounces
* Nyx Assassin - Mana Burn
* Slark - Essence Shift

#### Work currently, but probably still need a rework
* Bounty Hunter - Track
* Legion Commander - Duel

#### Working but not completely functional:

* Grimstroke - Soul bind (binds the target creep, but doesn't latch to another one as a secondary target)
* Undying - Decay (deals damage but does not steal strength)
* Shadow Demon - Disruption (does not create illusions)
